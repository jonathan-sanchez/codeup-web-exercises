//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//
// var numbersAddOne = [];
//
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length[i]; i += 1){
//     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
// }
// console.log(numbersAddOne); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] output.
//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

// let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
//     return num + 1;
// })
//
// console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

// let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.map(function(restaurant){
//     return restaurant.name;
// })
// console.log(nameList);
//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

const favoriteRestaurant = [{
    name: 'Plucker\'s Wing Bar',
    address: '14881 I-35 Frontage Rd Selma, Tx 78154',
    phone: '(210) 655-9464'
},
{
    name: 'Rolandos Super Tacos',
    address: '919 Hildebrand Ave San Antonio, Tx 78201',
    phone: '(210) 549-5950'
},
{
    name: '',
    address: '',
    phone: ''
}];

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)



//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!
// var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
//
// let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
//     return num % 2 === 0;
// });
//
// console.log(evens);
//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants
// let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurants.filter(function(restaurant){
//     return restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes('buffet');
// })
//
// console.log(hasBuffet);
//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!


//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
let familyMembers = [{
    name: "Samuel Sanchez Jr.",
    age: 50
    },{
    name:"Samuel Sanchez III",
    age: 30
    },{
    name: "Victoria Sanchez",
    age: 27
    }];

// console.log(familyMembers);
//.reduce method i used, pulled from curriculum.
const totalAge = familyMembers.reduce((total, familyMember ) => {
    return total + familyMember.age;
}, 0);

console.log(totalAge);
